Project Description: I have made my own Infrastructure of Cloud Computing hosted as Web Application that provides in demand access to a shared pool of Configuration Software as well as Computational Resources.

 SAAS (Software-As-a-Service) - Use of SSH (Server Shell) protocol to provide on demand access of various centrally hosted software without any installation via a Web Portal.

 StAAS (Storage-As-a-Service) - Both storage type can be dynamically increased or decreased using online formatting technique.
    Object Storage using NFS, SSHFS and SMB.
    Block Storage using iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface).
    
 IAAS (Infrastructure-As-a-Service) – Providing CLI (Command Line Interface) and GUI (Graphical User Interface) access of various operating system using virtualization technology implementation with Type-2 hypervisors like Qemu-KVM
